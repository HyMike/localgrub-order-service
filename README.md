# Order Service
[![Integration Test](https://github.com/HyMike/localgrub/actions/workflows/integration-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/HyMike/localgrub/actions/workflows/integration-tests.yml)

## Overview

The Order Service is a backend microservice for the LocalGrub platform. It is responsible for handling order creation, updating order status, and emitting order-related events to RabbitMQ. This service acts as the central point for order management and coordinates with other microservices (Payment, Restaurant, Notification) via event-driven communication.

**Scope:** 
Solo MVP project â€“ Designed and developed backend microservice

---

## Features

- Receives and stores new customer orders
- Emits `order_placed` events to RabbitMQ
- Updates order status (e.g., to "Completed")
- Emits `order_ready` events to RabbitMQ
- Integrates with Firebase for authentication and Firestore for order storage
- Designed for reliability and scalability
